# Dotfiles for my Fedora based Framework Laptop
My primary code editor is [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) with the Neovide GUI

To install my dotfiles `sudo` and `git` are required. You also have to be able to use `sudo` (probably by being part of the wheel group).
The package names are from Fedora Workstation.

Run the following command:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ninikx/dotfiles/main/install.sh | sh
```

CAUTION: never run shell scripts without checking them first
