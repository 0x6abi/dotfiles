# Dotfiles for a WSL Installation of Arch Linux
everything is tty based

To install my dotfiles `sudo` and `git` are required. You also have to be able to use `sudo` (probably by being part of the wheel group).
At the moment only Arch Linux is supported.

Run the following command:
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ninikx/dotfiles/wsl/install.sh | bash```

CAUTION: never run shell scripts without checking them first
