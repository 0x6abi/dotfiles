# Dotfiles for my Arch based Framework Laptop

![Screenshot of Desktop](desktop.png)

Dotfiles for Arch Linux with riverwm, zsh, neovim, qutebrowser, and overall a vim-based workflow, with the beautiful kanagawa colorscheme.

Only `curl`, `git` and `sudo` privileges are required to install the dotfiles.
Currently only compatible with Arch Linux (probably Arch-based Distros (as long as they use `systemd`) as well, I just didn't test it).

Run the following command:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnbi/dotfiles/main/install.sh | sh
```

CAUTION: never run shell scripts without checking them first
